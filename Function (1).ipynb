        " 1. What is the difference between a function\n",
        "     and a method in Python?\n",
        "   - A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.\n",
        "   It is defined using the def keyword.\n",
        "   A function is a standalone piece of code.\n",
        "     ex- def greet(name):\n",
        "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "greet(\"Samrat\")\n",
        "    whereas a method is also a block of code that performs a specific task, but it is associated with an object.It is defined within a class.A method is a function that belongs to an object.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. Explain the concept of function arguments\n",
        "     and parameters in Python.\n",
        "   - In python,parameters are the variables listed in the function definition,while arguments are the values passed to the function when it is called.\n",
        " 3. What are the different ways to define and\n",
        "     call a function in Python?\n",
        "  - There are the ways to define and call a function in Python are the following:\n",
        "   Define a function using thr\"def\" keyword followed by the function name ,parentheses for arguments,and a colon,while calling a function can be done by various arguments types like positional,keyword,arbitrary positional(*args),and arbitrary keyword arguments(**kwargs).\n",
        " 4. What is the purpose of the `return`\n",
        "     statement in a Python function?\n",
        "    -  The purpose of the `return`\n",
        "     statement in a Python function is to controlling the flow of execution within a function and for passing data back to the caller.\n",
        " 5. What are iterators in Python and how do  \n",
        "     they differ from iterables?\n",
        "    - Iterators in Python are objects that can transverse through iterable objects and returns data one at a time.It has a __next__method,which returns the next item in the stream ,while iterables are data structur that is capable of returning its member one at a time using for loop\n",
        " 6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "  -  Generators are special functions that\n",
        "     produce a sequence of values one at a time, on demand, instead of generating and storing them all at once.\n",
        "  They are defined using yield function.\n",
        " 7. What are the advantages of using generators\n",
        "     over regular functions?\n",
        "    - Benefits of Generators :-\n",
        "   Memory Efficiency: Generators don't store all values in memory at once, making them ideal for large datasets.\n",
        "   Lazy Evaluation: Values are generated only when needed, improving performance.\n",
        "   Readability: Generators can make code more concise and easier to understand for certain tasks.\n",
        " 8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "   - Lambda function in Python is small,anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword.It is used for creating small,throwways functions without the need to formally define a function using def.\n",
        " 9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "    - The purpose of the `map()` function in Python is to provides a way to process and transform all elements of an iterable without writing explicit loops and it is widely use to apply a single transformation function to all the iterable elements.\n",
        " 10. What is the difference between `map()`,\n",
        "     `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "     - The main difference between `map()`,\n",
        "     `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python is:  map() transforms elements, filter() selects elements, and reduce() aggregates elements.\n",
